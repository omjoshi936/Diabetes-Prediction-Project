# Diabetes Prediction Project
# Introduction
This project utilizes a dataset originally sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The primary objective of this dataset is to develop a predictive model for diagnosing whether a patient has diabetes, based on specific diagnostic measurements provided in the dataset. It's worth noting that the dataset includes data only from female individuals aged at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Overview
In this project, we follow a step-by-step approach:
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We perform EDA using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain insights into the dataset.
# Data Cleaning: We prepare the dataset by handling missing data and outliers.
# Model Building: We explore various machine learning models to predict diabetes outcomes.
# Model Evaluation: We assess model performance using relevant metrics.

# Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

# NumPy
# Pandas
# Matplotlib
# Seaborn
# Scikit-Learn
